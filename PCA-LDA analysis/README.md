# Principal Component Reduction and Linear Discriminant Analysis

This directory contains a complete PCA and LDA analysis of the business_survey_results.txt. This dataset contains a business survey of Greek companies. 
In this project, the reduction of the variables involved using PCA analysis and its separation using LDA analysis are examined. This notebook uses the analysis presented in
in this (https://github.com/gatsoulis/a_little_book_of_python_for_multivariate_analysis) github repo.

For the purpose of this analysis, data preprocessing techniques (such as variable convertion from categorical to numerical and NAN values management) are applied.
